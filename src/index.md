This is a demonstration of how to get an optimized performance with responsive images while letting content author writing simple Markdown.

## Eleventy

![Eleventy](/images/eleventy.png){.logo}

This site is generated by [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev/).

It uses [eleventy-plugin-images-responsiver](https://nhoizey.github.io/images-responsiver/eleventy-plugin-images-responsiver/), a plugin for Eleventy, to generate responsive image syntax with `srcset` and `sizes` attributes, so that loaded images are not too large (and heavy) for the area of the page they are supposed to fill.

## Cloudinary

The configuration of the plugin makes it generate multiple versions of the original images thanks to [Cloudinary](https://nho.io/cloudinary-signup)'s Fetch API and [URL based transformations](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_transformations).

Any other image resizing tool (SaaS or not) could be used with adapted configuration.

## Netlify

The site is built and hosted by [Netlify](https://netlify.com/).

The source code is managed on GitHub, and any push to the `main` branch triggers a build and deploy on Netlify.

Netlify is also convenient here to [proxy requests](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/rewrites-proxies/#proxy-to-another-service) to Cloudinary, so that a single domain is "seen" by the browser, which is better for performance. Thanks [Phil Hawksworth](https://twitter.com/philhawksworth/status/1328340868726726656) and [Tim Kadlec](https://timkadlec.com/remembers/2020-11-17-netlify-proxy-requests/) for this nice trick! üëç
